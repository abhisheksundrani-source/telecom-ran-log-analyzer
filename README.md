# 🚀 telecom-ran-log-analyzer
AI-based anomaly detection system for telecom RAN log analysis using streaming and window-based ML detection.  
Designed for integration into test automation frameworks and CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 📡 Overview
RAN (Radio Access Network) E2E tests can run for 6–12 hours, generating large log files.  
Failures typically appear as bursts rather than isolated events.

This project demonstrates a scalable, memory-efficient AI-driven system that:
- Streams large logs without loading them fully into memory
- Aggregates logs into processing windows
- Extracts telecom-specific failure frequencies
- Applies rule-based spike detection
- Uses Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- Returns a simple **PASS / FAIL** result for automation systems

## ✔ Key Design Principles
- Memory-efficient streaming (generator-based)
- Window-level analysis instead of raw log-level ML
- Hybrid rule-based + ML approach
- Automation-ready output
- API integration capability

## ❗ Problem Statement
In telecom RAN validation environments:
- Test executions run for long durations (6–12+ hours)
- Logs grow large (hundreds of MBs to GBs)
- Failures occur as bursts:
  - RRC Setup Failures
  - Handover Failures
  - Attach Rejects
  - NGAP/S1 Resets
  - Radio Link Failures (RLF)
- Manual log inspection is inefficient
- Static grep-based thresholds miss abnormal patterns

**Need:**  
Scalable log processing, intelligent anomaly detection, automation-friendly PASS/FAIL output.

## 📊 Detection Strategy
1️. **Failure Pattern Extraction**
- Tracks telecom-specific breakages:
- RRC Setup Failure
- Handover Failure
- Attach Reject
- NGAP Reset
- Radio Link Failure
- Kernel Panic

2️. **Window-Based Feature Aggregation**
- Logs are grouped into windows
- Failure frequencies are calculated per window
- Window-level features are passed to ML model

3️. **Hybrid Detection**
- Layer 1: Rule-based threshold detection
- Layer 2: Isolation Forest anomaly detection

This reduces false positives and improves reliability.
